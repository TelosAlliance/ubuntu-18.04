## Usage

### GitLab CI

To run a CI job using this image, add the following to your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file under the target job:

```yaml
image: telosalliance/ubuntu-18.04:latest
tags:
 - docker
```

### From a Shell Script

Using the `run-docker` shell script provided in this repository, you can use start the container using your existing username, group, and home directory.
The script can be used to run a single command inside the container or start an interactive shell.

### From Makefiles

You can use this container to execute any target by adding these lines to your `Makefile`:

```makefile
# Run any target by prefixing it with `docker-`
docker-%:
	docker run \
		--env LINUX_USER=$(shell id -un) \
		--env LINUX_UID=$(shell id -u) \
		--env LINUX_GROUP=$(shell id -gn) \
		--env LINUX_GID=$(shell id -g) \
		--env LINUX_DIR="$(PWD)" \
		--mount "src=$(HOME),target=$(HOME),type=bind" \
		telosalliance/ubuntu-18.04:latest \
		make $(@:docker-%=%)
```

### Building from Source

If you need to make changes, you can also clone this repository and build it yourself.

#### Building

```shell
make
```

#### Running

To run the image you built in the previous step, type:

```shell
make run
```

This will also set up a user and bind mount your /home directory inside the container.

You can optionally set extra args to pass to `docker` by calling `make` with `ARGS=<args>`.
For example, if you are having network problems you can try using the host's network:

```shell
make run ARGS="--network=host"
```
